# IndabaX Hackathon South-Sudan - Dreamers Team
## Application of Machine Learning Techniques in Real-Time Data

A real-time weather classification web app built for the **IndabaX South Sudan 2025 - Intermediate Track Hackathon**, under the theme:

---

## Project Overview

This project is a submission by **Team Dreamers** for the IndabaX South Sudan AI Hackathon. The competition challenged participants to build a weather condition classification model and **deploy it with a real-time user interface** to boost social impact through applied AI.

Our solution includes:
- A trained CNN model using EfficientNet/MobileNet on a labeled image dataset.
- A fully deployed FastAPI backend for real-time inference.
- A modern, responsive frontend built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- A UI that allows users to upload an image and see predicted weather conditions instantly.
